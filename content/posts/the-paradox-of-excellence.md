## **📋 Introduction**  

This article and the accompanying questionnaire aims to measure two critical organizational phenomena that most growing companies inevitably encounter. As organizations scale, sustaining a culture that not only values excellence but also effectively identifies and rewards it becomes essential. However, as excellence becomes widespread, a paradox emerges; one that can either dilute its value or end up overburdening excellent performers.


Defining excellence before we move further. It is not limited by these traits but on a broad stroke anybody who executes and exhibits these below traits might be considered an excellent performer. 

- Critical Thinking – Analyzes situations logically, identifies and resolves challenges.
- Decision-Making – Able to operate in a constrained environment, makes sound choices given uncertainty and context.
- Emotional Intelligence and empathy – Reads and responds to emotions effectively. Meters responses according to the situation.
- Accountability – Owns responsibilities and results.
- Resilience – Pushes through challenges without losing momentum.
- Bias for Action – Prioritizes execution over excessive analysis.
- Attention to Detail – Ensuring quality work.
- Resourcefulness – Finds solutions effectively with limited resources.

There are two key concepts that are defined as part of this article: ***Excellence Inflation*** and ***Inflation of Excellence***.
Before diving into how to measure them, let’s define what do they mean and to better understand these concepts, we can compare them to economic inflation.

## **Using an Analogy**

### **Inflation of Currency vs Currency Inflation**
| **Concept**              | **Definition**                                    | **Cause & Effect**                  |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Inflation of Currency** | Increase in money supply, reducing its value.   | **Cause** of currency inflation.    |
| **Currency Inflation**    | Increase in prices due to devalued money.       | **Effect** of increased money supply. |

 **Example:**
Imagine a small island where there are **10 apples for sale** and there is only **10 Rs in total** among people. Each apple costs **1 Re**.

- If suddenly the government **prints 100 Rs more**, now there is **110 Rs total**, but still only **10 apples**.  
- Since people have **more money**, sellers **increase apple prices** to **11 Rs each**.  
- The **apple didn’t change**, but its price **went up because money lost value**.

💡 **Key Idea:** **Too much currency in circulation reduces its value, leading to inflation.**

---

## **How does this relate to an Organization?**
Just like **Inflation of Currency leads to Currency Inflation**, the **Inflation of Excellence leads to Excellence Inflation**.


| **Economic Inflation** | **Workplace Inflation** |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| **Inflation of Currency** → More money printed → Currency Inflation *(prices rise, money loses its value)*. | **Inflation of Excellence** → Too many people labeled "excellent" → Excellence Inflation *(true excellence loses its meaning)*. |
| **Currency Inflation** → A few people hold most of the wealth, but its value doesn’t increase *(because the currency itself has lost its value)*. | **Excellence Inflation** → Excellence is in pockets demostrated by fewer folk, but their efforts aren’t valued appropriately or proportionally. |


Imagine an organization where:
- **Inflation of Excellence**: Everyone gets **top performance ratings**, making excellence **meaningless**.  
- **Excellence Inflation**: A few employees do **most of the work**, but **aren’t recognized or rewarded enough**.

💡 **Key Takeaway:** Just like **currency needs regulation**, **workplace excellence needs differentiation** to maintain its value.

A workplace or an organization thus might face a single phenomenan or a combination of the following 

✅ **Excellence Inflation** – High performers are **overburdened and undervalued**, leading to **burnout and disengagement**.  
✅ **Inflation of Excellence** – Performance **differentiation is weak**, making recognition and growth **ineffective**.  
✅ **Both** – High performers are **overloaded**, and performance **differentiation is also weak**, leading to **organizational inefficiency**.  
✅ **None** – A **healthy culture** where **performance is well-differentiated, work is balanced, and recognition is structured**.  


With that in mind, how do we diagnose if any of these phenomena are at work really?. 


## **Determine Inflation of Excellence, Excellence Inflation, Both, or None**

The easiest way to determine this is by enquiring with the people who will be most affected by it. So, below is a set of questions to be answered by the employee(s) as well as the Leadership respectively which hopefully will point us to the phenomena at play within the organization. 

The result might be a combination of both but the goal is to try and understand if the workplace suffers with either or both of them in order to determine a course of action to remedy them.  

Each question in the **Employee Survey** and **Leadership Survey** is designed to uncover **patterns in performance differentiation, workload distribution, recognition, and leadership decision-making**.
