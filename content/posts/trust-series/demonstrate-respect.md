> *Respect isn’t agreement. It is acknowledgment.*

---

**Abheer and Aarav are waiting at a street-side tea stall.
*A random man walks in to pick up his chai. Takes a sip and the scene unfolds. 
He starts berating the chai vendor for using too little sugar. He is technically right, but rude; curt, dismissive and demeaning. The vendor quietly remakes the tea. This customer storms off without eye contact*.**

**Abheer:** You know, he was right about the mistake. But, did he really have to talk like *that*?

**Aarav:** Yeah. Fixing sugar ratios shouldn’t come with humiliation.

**Abheer:** That’s exactly it. Why does it have to be disrepectful? He could treat the chai vendor with respect. Tell him there is less sugar, get it fixed and move on. 

**Aarav:** You mean by just… being nice?

**Abheer:** Not quite. Respect isn’t about being nice. It is about *recognizing worth* — especially when it costs you nothing.

**Aarav:** (sips tea) I don't know, man. Isn’t it better to be clear and get things done? Not everyone has time for pleasantries.

**Abheer:** I am appalled by what you just said. Respect isn’t a pleasantry. It is what makes someone feel *safe enough* to show up fully especially when they mess up. And it is the most basic of decency at least. 

**Aarav:** Alright, i understand, don't get all upset with me now. 

**Abheer:** Yes, but that's the thing about it right. Some folks clearly skipped the history lessons.

## Real-World Example: Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

**Abheer:** Remember the SLV launch that failed in the '70s?

**Aarav:** Vaguely. Wasn’t that Dr Kalam’s project?

**Abheer:** Yes it was. The launch failed and the media backlash was brutal, especially for a country like India investing in space tech and failing at it. But, Dr. Satish Dhawan — his boss — took the blame publicly. He didn’t throw Dr. Kalam under the bus.

**Aarav:** And when the next one succeeded?

**Abheer:** He sent Kalam to face the media. Gave him the credit. That kind of quiet respect builds lifelong loyalty and trust.

## Real-World Example: Sourav Ganguly

**Abheer:** Ganguly did something similar in the early 2000s for Indian Cricket. Backed youngsters like Sehwag and Yuvraj when they were still raw.

**Aarav:** Don't tell me he didn't take the heat when they underperformed?.

**Abheer:** C'mon. The prince of Calcutta, a great leader that he was, he did. He didn’t just pick them — he *stood by* them. That is what gave those players belief. You know what happened to Sehwag, Yuvraj and Harbhajan after that don't you? One of the greatest to play the game.

## What It Looks Like in Engineering

**Abheer:** Let’s say a developer ships something that breaks staging.

**Aarav:** Classic. Been there.

**Abheer:** Now imagine two responses.  
One: “You clearly didn’t test. This is quite basic.”  
Another: “This missed a critical test case and caused a regression. TIt delayed UAT by a day. Let’s debug it together and figure out how to avoid it next time. Shall we?”

**Aarav:** Hmm. So the second one is still honest. But, not humiliating.

**Abheer:** Exactly. Sugarcoating isn’t respect. And neither is being snarky.  
Respect is saying the *real thing* but, with clarity and care.

**Aarav:** I like that. But, it is a fine line isn't it? you don’t patronize, and you don’t explode. You level.

**Abheer:** Because that is what signals trust: “I believe you can take the truth and, grow from it.”

## How to Practice It

**Abheer:** So, i would say, always
- Assume good intent before jumping to blame.
- Invite members into high-context discussions.
- Pause before interrupting especially when someone is still learning.

**Aarav:** Hmm, So, 
- Acknowledge effort, separate the behavior from the person when giving feedback.
- Don’t dilute feedback to avoid discomfort — clarity *is* respect.

## Why Disrespect Erodes Trust

**Aarav:** Okay, I see your point. But in the real world, deadlines are brutal. Doesn’t too much “respect” slow things down?

**Abheer:** Respect doesn’t mean you *don’t* give feedback. It means people actually *hear* you when you do. You save time not repeating the same mistakes — or worse, dealing with silent resentment.

**Aarav:** Fair. You can't talk straight — like we said earlier about talking straight, if people don’t trust that you are for them, and, not against them.

**Abheer:** Exactly. Straight talk *with* respect.

**Abheer:** Also, Aarav, when you respect people, they stop worrying about survival and start thinking about contribution. It separates feedback from judgement, makes it safe and easier to speak up. 

**Aarav:** Okay. I’m sold.

**Abheer:** And, it starts with how you speak to the tea vendor.

**Aarav:** Alright, philosopher. What’s next?

**Abheer:** *Create Transparency.*

**Aarav:** Perfect. Let's see who gets uncomfortable this time.
