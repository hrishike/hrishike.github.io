> Trust can’t survive in the dark.

**The tea stall again, early evening. Aarav is already halfway through his first chai. Abheer is waiting for his change when a regular customer starts arguing with the stall owner.**

**Customer:** “Why is the chai ten rupees today? It was eight last week!”  

**Stall Owner:** “Prices went up.”  

**Customer:** “Why? Sugar? Milk? What happened?”  

**Stall Owner:** “It just did.”  

The customer storms off muttering.

**Abheer:** See that? That is exactly why I value transparency and find it easier to trust people who are transparent.  

**Aarav:** Come on. Firstly, It is just two rupees and Secondly everyone knows prices go up.  

**Abheer:** See, That’s not the point. The guy wasn’t upset about the amount. He was upset about not knowing why the price went up. And, the thing is he is buying from the vendor so he had the right to ask the question. If the owner had just put up a board saying “Sugar prices increased,” it would have killed the argument before it started.  

**Aarav:** You think that tiny bit of extra information matters?  

**Abheer:** People don’t like guessing games, whether it is tea prices or project deadlines. If you leave blanks, they will fill them with their own story and, you may not like that story.

### B.R. Ambedkar the father of the Indian constitution  
**Abheer:** Look at B.R. Ambedkar. He didn’t just fight for the rights of the marginalized; he made the *process* transparent. One of the most noteworthy action by him was to make the Drafting the Indian Constitution public. For a country which had just attained independence publicaly debating the draft constitution on the floor of the assembly is the epitome of transparency. It wasn’t just about laws it was about making the reasoning public so people could understand and debate it. That openness built legitimacy.  

**Aarav:** I agree in this case. Dr. Ambedkar knew clarity wasn’t optional. It was the foundation for trust in this case.

### Nelson Mandela  
**Abheer:** Same with Nelson Mandela isn't it?. When negotiating South Africa’s future, he didn’t hide his intentions. He openly shared his vision with both allies and opponents. It isn't easy to come from a state of apartheid to be transparent about the future right?. People didn’t always agree. But, they knew where he stood. That predictability was a form of trust.

### Netflix Culture Deck  
**Abheer:** And in business, the Netflix Culture Deck is the gold standard. Their culture isn't a secret. It is published for the world to see. They didn’t have to publish their internal principles, but they did showing employees and the world exactly how they operated  

**Aarav:** Okay, thats fine, but in engineering, you can’t be *that* transparent all the time. 

**Abheer:** I’m not saying post the source code on GitHub. I’m saying be transparent *inside the circle of trust*. If you’re holding back context from your own team, you’re sabotaging them.  

**Aarav:** But, Abheer, You can't be transparent about everything. Imagine contract or salary details being shared in the name of transparency? So, there is a line somewhere.

**Abheer:** This is where people get it wrong. Transparency doesn’t mean “tell everyone everything.”

**Aarav:** So then what is the difference?

**Abheer:** Confidentiality protects sensitive information. Legal, competitive, or ethical stuff. Transparency is about giving clarity *within the boundaries of that confidentiality*.

**Aarav:** Like saying, “We can’t share the exact vendor rates, but here’s how the cost impacts our budget.”

**Abheer:** Exactly. You explain the *why this happens* and *how this happens* so the receipient isn't left guessing. You don’t have to leak what is off-limits, but you don’t leave out a vacuum either.

**Aarav:** So then what you are saying is that it isn't about full exposure but it is about context.

**Abheer:** Yep. Oversharing of information can break trust just as fast as secrecy. The skill is in the balance.

### Engineering Scenario: The Secretive Roadmap  
**Abheer:** Remember that project where the product roadmap was changed midway and was very secretive untilt he very last moment?  

**Aarav:** Oh yes! how would i forget. I was the Lead developer on it.  We had to shelve half the features that we had been working on and then start all over on some other features that got prioritized. I got constant questions about did we lose customers? Is funding drying up?  

**Abheer:** Exactly. This secrecy was eroding trust. 

**Aarav:** I agree! Engineers stopped committing to timelines because they didn’t know when the rug would be pulled again. And morale tanked because no one felt in control.  

**Aarav:** So, i got to the bottom of it and eventually the Product owner made an announcement in the AHM that We’re reprioritizing because feature XYZ unlocks revenue sooner. That is why ABC is pushed to next quarter! 
And! voila. anxiety disappeared. 

**Abheer:** That’s the thing though isn't it? transparency isn’t about dumping all information; it is about giving *the right people the right information at the right time*. That is what builds trust. It takes away the room for rumors and speculation, makes you predictable and that builds confidence.  

**Aarav:** That’s right. It is the same as telling me the chai rate went up because sugar is costlier now.

**Abheer:** And suddenly, you’re okay paying 10 rupees instead of 8.

**Aarav:** *grinning* Fine, you’ve sold me. Talking straight, like we said earlier, is saying what you mean. But creating transparency is showing people the “why” behind it.  

**Abheer:** Exactly. One without the other is half-baked.  
**Aarav:** Alright then — what’s next?  

**Abheer:** Right Wrongs. Because transparency doesn’t mean much if you won’t fix mistakes once they’re in the open.
