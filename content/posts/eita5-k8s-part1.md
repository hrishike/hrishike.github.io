# Kubernetes for a 5-Year-Old: The Hotel Analogy (Part 1)

## Introduction  
This is again an article drawing parallels from the real world for explaining a distributed system such as kubernetes (k8s) to a 5 year old. 

Lets imagine you are traveling to a big, luxurious hotel for a vacation. The hotel is well-organized, with different rooms, amenities, and staff members ensuring guests have a smooth stay. Now, let‚Äôs take this hotel experience and compare it to a distributed platform such as **Kubernetes**.  

In this two-part series, we will explore **Kubernetes concepts through the analogy of a hotel**. In this part, we‚Äôll walk through the process of **checking into the hotel** and how it relates to Kubernetes.  


## Arriving at the Hotel (Ingress Controller)
The guests **drive to the hotel** and are greeted by a valet parking service. The valet (called the **Ingress Controller**) takes their car and parks it in the designated parking lot.  

- **In Kubernetes:**  
  - Just like the valet directs cars to the correct parking spots, an **Ingress Controller** routes incoming traffic / ingress (requests) to the right backend service.  
  - It ensures that the API requests reach the correct destination inside the Kubernetes cluster.  


## Checking In: The Reception Desk (Scheduler & etcd)
Once the guest(s) enter the hotel, they walk up to the receptionist at the front desk. The receptionist asks for their identity proof and authenticates them before assigning them a room.  

### A Guest is a Pod in Kubernetes  
- A single person checking in represents a **single-container Pod**.  
- A family checking in together represents a **multi-container Pod**, where multiple guests share the same hotel room.  

The receptionist **checks their system (which would be etcd here)** to find an available room. If the guest is a VIP member with high priority, they might get a **suite instead of a regular room** which denotes priority or scheduling considerations .  

- **In Kubernetes:**  
  - The **scheduler (receptionist)** assigns **Pods (guests)** to **Nodes (hotel rooms)** based on available resources.  
  - The **etcd database** stores cluster information, just like the receptionist's system stores details about **which rooms are available**.  
  - Some rooms (Nodes) may have special requirements (e.g., only for VIPs). Kubernetes handles this with **taints and tolerations**, ensuring that high-priority guests get the best available rooms.  

**Example:**  
A guest with a loyalty cards **Gold Membership** gets assigned **Room #401**, which is a presidential suite. This room is on the **4th floor** (which would represent a **namespace** in Kubernetes).  

## Settling in: Housekeeping Assistance (Controller Manager)
After check-in, a **housekeeping assistant** helps carry the guest's luggage and shows them to their room.  

- **In Kubernetes:**  
  - The **Controller Manager** ensures that Pods (guests) are correctly set up and running smoothly.  
  - It helps allocate resources like CPU, memory, and storage, just like the **housekeeping team** ensures the room has all the amenities requested by the guest.  

Since this guest is staying in a **presidential suite**, they receive **additional resources**, such as:  
- **A large TV**  
- **A king-size bed**  
- **Three bedrooms**  
- **A 300-liter fridge**  

These resources are allocated because the guest requested them during booking (requests and limits) ‚Äîjust like Kubernetes ensures that **Pods get the right amount of CPU, memory, and storage** based on their requests.  

## Room Service: Ordering Food (Kubernetes Service & ConfigMap)
After settling in, the guest(s) **order food from room service**. Lets say, they have a **dietary restriction (vegan or Jain food)**, but they don‚Äôt need to mention it again because it was already recorded during check-in.  

- **In Kubernetes:**  
  - Room service is like a **Kubernetes Service**, ensuring that the food request reaches the correct kitchen (the right workload).  
  - The dietary preference was saved earlier at check-in, just like **ConfigMaps store important configuration data** for applications.  

**Example:**  
The guest‚Äôs dietary preference gets recorded during check-in, so the kitchen automatically prepares a **vegan or Jain meal** without needing them to repeat it. Similarly, **ConfigMaps ensure applications run with the correct settings without needing changes every time**.  

## Reconciling state: AC Not Working (Replication Controller & ReplicaSet)
In the evening, the guest(s) realize that the air conditioning in their room isn‚Äôt working. The centralized monitoring system on the receptionist points out that the AC is faulty (proactively) and lets the guests know about it that there will be arrangements made for them to get another room.  

- The **housekeeping team and receptionist** quickly arranges for a **new presidential suite**, ensuring that the guests don‚Äôt face any discomfort.  
- The guests **move to an identical room** with the same amenities.  

- **In Kubernetes:**  
  - If Pods (one or multiple guests) experiences an issue, **Replication Controllers and ReplicaSets** ensure that a replacement Pod is created on another healthy Node.  
  - Kubernetes makes sure that applications keep running by automatically **spawning new instances if something goes wrong**.  

**Example:**  
If a **node becomes unavailable**, Kubernetes **automatically replaces the broken Pod with a new one** on another available Node, just like the hotel moves the guest to another identical suite.  


By comparing Kubernetes to a **hotel experience**, it makes it relatively easier to get a headstart to understand how different components work together and the role of those components: This in no means tries to trivialize the complex distributed system of kubernetes but provides a mental model to understand it.
