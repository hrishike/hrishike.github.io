# Leverage: The Real Currency in Organizations  

This is my thought experiment in writing an article or a short post in a conversational manner. I loved the book "The courage to be disliked", and i have tried to mimic the style in presenting an argument and a counter argument making it a lot more personable. 

*A conversation between Aarav and Abheer*

It is a Sunday afternoon. Aarav and Abheer are seated at a quiet coffee shop. They have been talking about work, influence, and what really moves the needle within organizations.


## What Really Moves Things

**Aarav**: You know. what I’ve come to believe lately?

**Abheer**: Go on. Tell me what is your new theory, opinion or your latest Aarav-ism?

**Aarav**: See, i have come to believe that leverage is the *only* real currency inside an organization. It is the only thing if one possesses can move the needle. 

**Abheer**: Only currency? Not skills, not relationships, not visibility?

**Aarav**: Nope. Those are symptoms. Leverage is the root. It gets you autonomy, respect, recognition, better compensation and more influence. Everything else is just a wrapper.

**Abheer**: Bold claim. I am not convinced yet but lets talk more.



### The Case for Leverage

**Aarav**: See, from how i am trying to put it. Leverage isn’t about threats or politics. It’s quiet. It’s earned. It is the ability to influence outcomes because of the value you consistently bring. 

**Abheer**: Define "value." That is such an overloaded term.

**Aarav**: You are right. It is. But, at a broad level, it usually shows up in four forms:
- **Competence**: You consistently deliver.
- **Character**: You’re trusted when things get hard.
- **Context**: You understand the system, not just your role.
- **Network**: You know who to call — and they pick up.

**Abheer**: Hmm, Okay, so this isn’t about positional power. It’s about contribution and trust.

**Aarav**: Exactly!. And I’ve got two examples to ground this and base my theory on (*amongst others and my experience ofcourse*).


### 📜 Vasili Arkhipov: Character in a situation of crisis

**Aarav**: In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet sub was being depth-charged. Two officers agreed to launch a nuclear torpedo. One more signature was needed.

**Abheer**: And?

**Aarav**: Vasili Arkhipov said no. He wasn’t the most senior, but was well respected, he had; trust, clarity, and calm. His decision may have prevented World War III.

**Abheer**: That’s leverage — not loud, not formal — just earned authority in a critical moment.



### 🧮 Katherine Johnson: Precision as soft power

**Aarav**: At NASA, Katherine Johnson was the mathematician astronauts trusted the most. Before John Glenn orbited Earth, he asked for her to verify the calculations manually — even after computers had run them.

**Abheer**: Hmm. Quiet credibility. It must have been built by performing at the highest level though isn't it? That’s the kind of leverage that shows up when it matters.

**Aarav**: Absolutely! You show up everyday at the top of your game and you perform, quietly and steadily and gradually build credibility and that in turn is a position of leverage. Let me get to the thought experiment of how this influence actually grows over time, sort of a ripple.



## The Stages of Leverage

---

### 1. Executional Leverage

> _"You’re trusted to do your job exceptionally well."_

**Aarav**: This is the base layer. You execute with clarity, quality, and speed. People know you deliver.

**Abheer**: So, no frills. Just solid work. You are considered reliable.

**Aarav**: Yes, and, you earn it by doing the work that matters — repeatedly and quietly.

**How to grow this:**
- Fix things before you're asked.
- Be consistent, not just clever.
- Own your outcomes.

---

### 2. Relational Leverage

> _"People trust you — and want to work with you."_

**Aarav**: Now your influence expands into how you support others. You’re the go-to person when things feel fuzzy.

**Abheer**: Hmm. The one that glue people. Steady hands in chaos. Teams don’t work without them.

**How to grow this:**
- Give credit, take the blame. Offer help freely.
- Listen more than you speak.
- Make others feel safe to fail.

---

### 3. Contextual Leverage

> _"You understand the system, not just your role in it."_

**Aarav**: You see how things connect — talent management, techology, customer, business, finance. You anticipate and/or prepare yourself and then, not just react.

**Abheer**: I see the folks who stop asking “what should I do?” — and start asking “what needs to happen?”

**How to grow this:**
- Build cross-functional impact, understand other functions that are under operations.
- Ask second-order questions.
- Get involed in upstream and downstream functions of the responsibility.

---

### 4. Credibility Leverage

> _"Your voice carries weight beyond your immediate circle."_

**Aarav**: Now you are being consulted early. Not because of your title but, because of your track record.

**Abheer**: I see, like Arkhipov — when trust, not position, steers the ship.

**How to grow this:**
- Make thoughtful decisions that age well.
- Own your mistakes and recover visibly.
- Teach what you’ve learned — with clarity.

---

### 5. Legacy Leverage

> _"You shape what gets remembered — and repeated."_

**Aarav**: You have outgrown your role. Your ideas, systems, or mentorship live on. You have become part of how the organization works even after you’re gone.

**Abheer**: Hmm, Marie Curie. Two Nobel Prizes, but more importantly  work ethic, discoveries and a pioneer in the field of radioactivity. She changed how science was done.

**How to grow this:**
- Share generously what you have learned.
- Teach others.
- Build systems that work without you.

---

**Abheer**: So... this ripple model is strong. But I have questions.

**Aarav**: Haha, I was counting on it.

## Is Leverage Enough?


> _"Leverage Can Be Fragile"_


**Abheer**: What gives you leverage today might vanish tomorrow. Org shifts. New managers. Tech changes. And then it is reset.

**Aarav**: True. Leverage isn’t permanent. It has to evolve with the environment. (Maybe the final stage is but not always if its a completely different playing field.)

 
> _"Power Without Privilege Isn’t Always Enough"_

**Abheer**: And some people build leverage, but the system doesn’t see it. Bias, politics, distance — they all skew who gets credit.

**Aarav**: Thats right, even earned leverage might not convert into real influence. I have experienced this. 

**Abheer**: Exactly. The playing field is never equal.

> _"Not All Influence Looks Like Leverage"_

**Abheer**: What about emotional labor? The quiet people holding culture together? The ones who check in after hard meetings? That’s leverage too. It just doesn’t get headlines. 

**Aarav**: I'm not sure that is leverage but, yes, that is invisible work. goes unrecognized. But, it is essential. Essential to the organization atleast. 

> _"Leverage Can Turn Toxic"_

**Abheer**: And let’s be honest — leverage can corrupt. I’ve seen people hoard influence, block change, become bottlenecks.

**Aarav**: Yes, yes, leverage without self-awareness without a shared goal between you and the org becomes a form of control.


> _"Teams Build Greatness — Not Just Individuals"_

**Abheer**: And Aarav, the biggest flaw is that this whole conversation has focused on *individual* leverage. But most meaningful work is done in *teams*.

**Aarav**: haha yeah, if you build an org that only rewards personal leverage you get egos, not ecosystems



## Shared Power Is Still Power

**Aarav**: Okay. Let me say it better now.

Leverage isn’t the *only* currency — but it’s the most earned, most durable, and the most compoundable one.

**Abheer**: And it only matters if you use it well.

**Aarav**: Yes, to create space, to elevate others, to shape systems that work — with or without you.

**Abheer**: That’s not just leverage. That is a legacy.
