      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ðŸ“‹ Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article and the accompanying questionnaire aims to measure two critical organizational phenomena that most growing companies inevitably encounter. As organizations scale, sustaining a culture that not only values excellence but also effectively identifies and rewards it becomes essential. However, as excellence becomes widespread, a paradox emerges; one that can either dilute its value or end up overburdening excellent performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining excellence before we move further. It is not limited by these traits but on a broad stroke anybody who executes and exhibits these below traits might be considered an excellent performer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-journey&#34;&gt;My Journey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m Hrishi, a computer science graduate with 20+ years in the software industry. I thrive on challenges and stepping outside my comfort zoneâ€”most recently, helping a startup scale from a handful of engineers to over 200 employees. My contributions have spanned engineering, hiring, sales, presales, finance, and now business operations. Iâ€™m always looking for new problems to solve. I love mentoring, sharing knowledge, and debating strong opinions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;early-years--education&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Years &amp;amp; Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was born into a middle-income family in Thane, Maharashtra. I wasnâ€™t a standout student in school or collegeâ€”academic scores never really interested me. What did? Tinkering. I spent my time setting up house wiring with my dad, fixing appliances, opening up VCRs, mixers, and tape recorders just to put them back together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
