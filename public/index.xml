&lt;p>Over my career span, I have seen many engineers miss out on well-deserved recognition. And this is not because their work wasnâ€™t great, but because they didnâ€™t represent it appropriately.
Whether itâ€™s providing status updates or showcasing completed work, how you communicate matters just as much as what you communicate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any business, an engineer (or any professional, really) interacts with at least three to four different personas:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Paradox of Excellence</title><link>https://hrishi.info/posts/the-paradox-of-excellence/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 13:52:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://hrishi.info/posts/the-paradox-of-excellence/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="-introduction">&lt;strong>ðŸ“‹ Introduction&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This article and the accompanying questionnaire aims to measure two critical organizational phenomena that most growing companies inevitably encounter. As organizations scale, sustaining a culture that not only values excellence but also effectively identifies and rewards it becomes essential. However, as excellence becomes widespread, a paradox emerges; one that can either dilute its value or end up overburdening excellent performers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Defining excellence before we move further. It is not limited by these traits but on a broad stroke anybody who executes and exhibits these below traits might be considered an excellent performer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://hrishi.info/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hrishi.info/about/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-journey">My Journey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Iâ€™m Hrishi, a computer science graduate with 20+ years in the software industry. I thrive on challenges and stepping outside my comfort zoneâ€”most recently, helping a startup scale from a handful of engineers to over 200 employees. My contributions have spanned engineering, hiring, sales, presales, finance, and now business operations. Iâ€™m always looking for new problems to solve. I love mentoring, sharing knowledge, and debating strong opinions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was born into a middle-income family in Thane, Maharashtra. I wasnâ€™t a standout student in school or collegeâ€”academic scores never really interested me. What did? Tinkering. I spent my time setting up house wiring with my dad, fixing appliances, opening up VCRs, mixers, and tape recorders just to put them back together.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
