      <title>Phantom Jams in Orgs</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-phantom-jam-in-organizations&#34;&gt;The Phantom Jam in Organizations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently learnt about something called Phantom Jams (this while being part of a traffic jam myself. I am from Bangalore, so thats nothing new for me.)
The fascinating part is that a phantom jam has got nothing to do with a crash. They start with a tap on the brake and the car behind then brakes harder so on and so forth which causes a cascading effect triggering a chain reaction, eventually causing subsequent drivers to slow down and create a jam. This can and mostly happens even in relatively free-flowing traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Auth and Authz for a 5 yr old</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;authentication-and-authorization-to-a-5yr-old&#34;&gt;Authentication and Authorization to a 5yr old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to help understand concepts by breaking them down and drawing parallels in the world to give the reader a model to understand them. Try to explain them as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an attempt to explain Authorization and Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take a visit to a theme park as an example. You and your 5 year old visit a theme park say, Disney world or Universal studios. And there are lots of fun activities within the park such as fun rides, theme based activities etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>With Great Responsibilities Come Great Rights (and Guardrails)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spiderman said, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with great power comes great responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; I would say &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with great responsibilities come great rights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And i have seen far too many engineers, team leads, managers, middle management fail because they weren&amp;rsquo;t empowered/enabled to make the decisions for the responsibilities assigned to them. Here is my attempt to provide some thoughts on how do you make it work (what has worked for me)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a social construct we always talk about rights and responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Over my career span, I have seen many engineers miss out on well-deserved recognition. And this is not because their work wasnâ€™t great, but because they didnâ€™t represent it appropriately.
Whether itâ€™s providing status updates or showcasing completed work, how you communicate matters just as much as what you communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any business, an engineer (or any professional, really) interacts with at least three to four different personas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kubernetes for a 5-Year-Old: The Hotel Analogy (Part 1)</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is again an article drawing parallels from the real world for explaining a distributed system such as kubernetes (k8s) to a 5 year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets imagine you are traveling to a big, luxurious hotel for a vacation. The hotel is well-organized, with different rooms, amenities, and staff members ensuring guests have a smooth stay. Now, letâ€™s take this hotel experience and compare it to a distributed platform such as &lt;strong&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Excellence</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-paradox-of-excellence/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ðŸ“‹ Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article and the accompanying questionnaire aims to measure two critical organizational phenomena that most growing companies inevitably encounter. As organizations scale, sustaining a culture that not only values excellence but also effectively identifies and rewards it becomes essential. However, as excellence becomes widespread, a paradox emerges; one that can either dilute its value or end up overburdening excellent performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining excellence before we move further. It is not limited by these traits but on a broad stroke anybody who executes and exhibits these below traits might be considered an excellent performer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
