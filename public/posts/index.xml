      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;authentication-and-authorization-to-a-5yr-old&#34;&gt;Authentication and Authorization to a 5yr old&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this article is to help understand concepts by breaking them down and drawing parallels in the world to give the reader a model to understand them. Try to explain them as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an attempt to explain Authorization and Authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets take a visit to a theme park as an example. You and your 5 year old visit a theme park say, Disney world or Universal studios. And there are lots of fun activities within the park such as fun rides, theme based activities etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This article and the accompanying questionnaire aims to measure two critical organizational phenomena that most growing companies inevitably encounter. As organizations scale, sustaining a culture that not only values excellence but also effectively identifies and rewards it becomes essential. However, as excellence becomes widespread, a paradox emerges; one that can either dilute its value or end up overburdening excellent performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining excellence before we move further. It is not limited by these traits but on a broad stroke anybody who executes and exhibits these below traits might be considered an excellent performer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
